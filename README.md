Hi, I’m Aryan.

I’m a backend-focused developer who likes building things from scratch and understanding how systems work internally. I mostly work on backend-heavy and systems-oriented projects.

What I work on:
- Backend systems and APIs
- Multithreaded and concurrent programs in C++
- Low-level networking (TCP, WebSockets)
- Queues, background workers, and rate limiting
- Full-stack apps with authentication , 3rd-Party API Integrations and deployment

I’ve built:
- WebSocket servers from scratch in C++
- A high-performance token bucket rate limiter
- Backend systems using Redis, queues, and workers
- Deployed full-stack web applications

My main projects are pinned below.
