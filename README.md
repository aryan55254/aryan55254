Hi, I’m Aryan.

I'm a developer who builds software primarily using C++ and
TypeScript. My work ranges from networking and systems projects in C++ to full-stack web applications in TypeScript. I am well-versed in the Node.js ecosystem and technologies like Redis, along with infrastructure tools like Docker. Currently, I am deepening my skills in low-level systems programming, distributed systems, and backend engineering

Currently Working On Chronos : A high-performance C++ job scheduler engineered for sub-microsecond latency. It employs a hybrid queuing model—lock-free work-stealing deques for cache locality and MPSC mailboxes for contention-free injection. Integrated with an epoll reactor, it seamlessly unifies asynchronous I/O and compute tasks.
